* Notes

** Work Generation

1. Syndicate members generate the coinbase address together using a
   DKG protocol.
2. All syndicate members generate the blocks and payout to the miners.
3. All syndicate members randomise the work definition so that miners
   are not working on the same "search space".
   1. The randomisation comes from the coinbase transaction generated
      by the syndicate member - as sigscript for coinbase input or an
      extra op_return in the output.

*** Address Generation

1. Syndicate members have a new address generated in advance
   1. This is achieved by continuously running DKG protocol.
2. Syndicate members are free to reuse addresses for next blocks. They
   can later generate new address and send work update messages to
   miners.   
      
** Share Generation

1. Miners generate shares for the work generate by syndicate members.

** Block Discovery

1. A bitcoin block is found as one of the shares.
2. When a syndicate member sees a bitcoin block, it
   1. Immediately broadcastas it to bitcoin
   2. It allows broadcasts to the syndicate members, who in turn
      broadcast it to bitcoin network. This speeds up the
      dissemination of the broadcast protocol.
3. Syndicate members switch to the new block and new work for the new
   block.
4. 

** Share Propagation Among Syndicate Members

1. Syndicate members sign shares they receieve from miners and
   broadcast them to the rest of the syndicate.
   1. Miners this way are "delegating their voting" rights to
      syndicate members.
   2. Miners can withdraw these voting rights by switching to a
      different syndicate member or a different mining syndicate
      altogether.      

** Syndicate Fee Distribution Algorithm      

1. Syndicate membership is weighted by how much of the hashpower they
   have attracted.
   1. All syndicate members see this hash power and can derive the
      membership view of the syndicate by running a deterministic
      algorithm.

** Payouts

1. Coinbase pays the syndicate.
2. The syndicate members compute the miner payouts, each one builds
   the transaction to payout miners.
3. If syndicate members sign the payout transaction using FROST, then
   we have agreement on the payout computation.

*** How do syndicate members generate the same payout tx?

1. Deterministic algorithm to order payments to miners
2. How is each syndicate member sure they have all the messages
   required to generate the same payout tx?
   1. Run reliable broadcast and Raft/Paxos between syndicate members
      every fixed interval period to agree on the share history
      receieved from miners.

* Comparison to Braidpool

** Advantages of Radpool

1. Zero resistance to switch from a centralised pool to radpool.
   1. Miner's don't have to run any services or nodes - just as in
      current centralised pool setups.
   2. Miner's simply point their workers to the radpool's stratum
      server and start mining.
2. Payout mechanism does not need covenants to resist a 51% attack to
   steal miner hashrate.
   1. Payout distribution is committed to in the coinbase. So payout
      reward can't be stolen post-fact.
