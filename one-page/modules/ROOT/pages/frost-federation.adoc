= FROST Federation

Radpool depends on a federation of nodes that run the
https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf[FROST threshold signature
protocol] as well as a proven distributed key generation protocol
included in the FROST paper (called KeyGen). We have an implementation
of a node for running a federation that uses KeyGen protocol to
determine a shared public key. The federation then uses the FROST
threshold signature protocol to sign bitcoin transaction used for
miner payouts.

The https://github.com/pool2win/frost-federation:[FROST Federation
implementation] is an independent project as other applications apart
from Radpool can use it for other purposes.

== Membership

The KeyGen protocol is run by all parties who want to participate in
the federation. This acts as a point of control where existing
federation members have to accept new members by successfully
completing a KeyGen protocol. The syndicate membership protocol,
described later, explains the rules used by current members to accept
new members for Radpool.


== Federation Broadcast Communication

Once the membership is confirmed, FROST federation also provides a
reliable broadcast within the federation. We later use this broadcast
primitive to replicate shares received by a MSP to all other MSPs.
