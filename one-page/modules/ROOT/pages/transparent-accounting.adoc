== Transparent and Open Operations

A mining federation results in a transparent pool where all federation
members validate all other federation members are working correctly. If
a member is not working according to the agreed upon protocols, the
honest federation members stop rewarding the dishonest member and will
eventually remove the dishonest member from the federation.

The above is made possible by point to point communication between
federation members as well as the bitcoin contracts between the
federation members.
