= Transparent and Open Operations

A mining syndicate results in a transparent pool where all syndicate
members validate all other syndicate members are working correctly. If
a member is not working according to the agreed upon protocols, the
honest syndicate members stop rewarding the dishonest member and will
eventually remove the dishonest member from the syndicate.

The above is made possible by point to point communication between
syndicate members as well as the bitcoin contracts between the
syndicate members.
