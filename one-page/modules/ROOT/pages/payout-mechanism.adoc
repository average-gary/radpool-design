= Coinbase, Blocktemplates and Payouts

The key component that validates the proposal is how coinbases and
blocktemplates are constructed by federation members and how payouts
are made to miners.

.Payout sub-system requirements
. Miners should be able to exit the pool unilaterally with all their coins, without requiring any permission from the federation or anyone else.
. Federation should be able to make progress as long as threshold number of members are honest.
. Miners should receive payout for all their shares using PPLNS reward distribution.
. Federation members should not be able to steal miners shares.
. Miners work on a block only if they know their fair share of payout is included in the coinbase.
