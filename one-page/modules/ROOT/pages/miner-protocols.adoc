= Miner Protocols

We describe the protocols executed when a new miners registers with an
MSP, or wants to cash out and leave the pool.

== New Miner Registration

A miner register with any of the MSP by following the protocol to
create a new authentication token. This can follow any of the well
known protocols like OAuth. The miner submits a public key to which it
should receive payouts.

A miner will obtain a similar authentication token from multiple MSPs,
at least two backup MSPs. The miner should use the same public key to
register with multiple syndicate members.

Using this authentication token, the miner can open a communication
channel to send and receive stratum messages to the MSP. At the end of
the miner registration, the miner is can start sending shares to the
syndicate.
