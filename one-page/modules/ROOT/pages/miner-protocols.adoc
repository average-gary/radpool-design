= Miner Protocols

We describe the protocols executed when a new miners registers with an
MSP, or wants to cash out and leave the pool.

== New Miner Registration

A miner can register with any of the MSP by following the protocol to
create a new authentication token. The authentication token is used to
submit stratum messages to the MSP. The miner submits a public key
to which it should receive payouts.

A miner will obtain a similar authentication token from multiple MSPs,
at least two backup MSPs. The miner should use the same public key to
register with multiple syndicate members, so that the all MSPs cant
track the miner's hashrate in case of the miner switching MSPs.

Using this authentication token, the miner can open a communication
channel to send and receive stratum messages to the MSP. At the end of
the miner registration, the miner can start sending shares to the
syndicate.

== Miner Leaves the Pool

No interactive protocol is requried for the miner to take their money
and leave the pool. The miner has custody of the DLC outputs paying
the miner at all times.

== Miner Uses Backup MSP

A miner can use the backup MSP at any point by changing their stratum
URLs. The miner registers with an MSP as per the
<<_new_miner_registration>> protocol and starts exchanging stratum
messages with the MSP.
