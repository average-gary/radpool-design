= Resisting Sybil Attacks

When a miner sends their share to a syndicate member, the member
signs the shares before broadcasting to the entire syndicate. This
identifies shares with the syndicate members that brought the
hashrate to the pool. The figure below shows how this works.

TODO: Add diagram about shares being signed

To prevent anyone from joining the syndicate by bringing in capital,
we require that syndicate members also bring in hashrate to the
pool. Further, to resist sybil attacks by anyone joining the
syndicate, we limit the threshold participation to the members that
bring the top 2/3rds of the hashrate.
