== Resisting Sybil Attacks

When a miner sends their share to a federation member, the member
signs the shares before broadcasting to the entire federation. This
identifies shares with the federation members that brought the
hashrate to the pool. The figure below shows how this works.

To prevent anyone from joining the federation by bringing in capital,
we require that federation members also bring in hashrate to the
pool. Further, to resist sybil attacks by anyone joining the
federation, we limit the threshold participation to the members that
bring the top 2/3rds of the hashrate.
