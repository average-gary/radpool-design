== Mining Federation as the Solution

Mining syndicate resists mining centralisation by breaking up the
centralised pool into a federation. The members of the federation
build blocktemplates, enable miner payouts, and help reduce variance
for miners.

There are two types of parties in the system.

. Miners - these run mining facilities and do not need to run bitcoin node or a fedpool node.
. Federation members - these run bitcoin nodes, generate block templates and sign miner payout transactions using threshold signatures.

Miners register with a federation members and communicate with the
federation using stratum mining protocol. Federation members take on
the complexity in this design, allowing miners to switch from
centralised pools without running any services. Here's a list of
responsibilities the federation members take on:

. Build block templates.
. Run services to let miners register with them.
. Run stratum servers that miners use to generate shares.
. Run consistent share accounting by using state replication across the members.
. Sign miner payout transactions using Schnorr threshold signatures.

The coinbase and payout transaction are constructed such that neither
the miner nor any federation member can steal coins or prevent the
mining federation from making progress.
