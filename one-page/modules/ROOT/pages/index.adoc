= Radpool - Syndicated Mining Pool

Current bitcoin mining pools are resulting in ever increasing
centralisation pressure on mining pools. This centralisation pressure
is increasing the threat of transaction censorship on bitcoin.

We need a solution to decentralise mining to resist transaction
censorship. In the current efforts, the pools are still either run
from a single central entity or are trying to be fully P2P. Both the
approaches have challenges. Single entity pools are by their very
nature centralised, and full p2p pools are challenging to scale to
limits for providing enough reduction in block discovery variance.

In these pages, we present a novel design - radpool - that breaks up
the centralised single entity into a syndicate running the pool. This
allevaites the scalability challenges faced by a fully p2p pool while
dramatically increases mining decentralisation, thus improving the
resilience to transaction censorship.

The salient features of the design presented are the following and we
describe them in detail in the rest of the pages.

1. Block template construction is decentralised as each syndicate
member build an independent blocktemplate.
2. Share accounting is transparent, so the pool is fully auditable.
3. Syndicate members earn a yield in exchange of locking liquidity to
fund payouts for miners.
4. The pool provides open access to mining data so we can build
futures contracts to help miners hedge their risks.
5. The payout mechanism allows unilateral exits for miners and
syndicate members, thus making the solution non-custodial.
6. Switching to Radpool from current centralised pools has zero
friction for miners.
