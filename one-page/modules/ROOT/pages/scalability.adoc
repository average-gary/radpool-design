= Scalability

The scalability of Radpool in terms of handling more miners and MSPs
as the pool's hashrate grows is dependent on the scalability of the
threshold signing scheme.

We plan to roll out various solutions, from the least development
effort to more. Our first release will use the FROST threshold
signature scheme along with the KeyGen protocol described in the FROST
paper. This will give us a non-robust solution and we will re-reun
both KeyGen and TSS in case of failures by removing the failed
parties. After we have built all the services around this scheme that
makes Radpool work, we will extend KeyGen with scheme described in
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-006-0347-3[Gennaro et. al.]
to make it robust in the presence of failures. Finally, to scale
threshold signatures we are considering replacing FROST TSS with
https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/374.pdf[Lindell's scheme] that required
three rounds but is robust in the presence of failures.
