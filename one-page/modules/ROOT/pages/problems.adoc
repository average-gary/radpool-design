= Problems

Current efforts to build mining pools can be split into two
approaches - centralised pools with a single entity running the pool
services or P2P pools. Centralised pools carry out share validation,
accounting and reward distribution using a single entity. In contrast,
P2P pools push these operational responsibilities to the edges of the
network - i.e. the miners.

In this section, we describe the problems faced by both these
approaches.

== Problems with Centralised Pool

=== Vulnerable to Attacks

Centralised pools remain vulnerable to attacks that can force them to
censor transactions. Given all centralised pools currently run
proprietary stacks run in the cloud, it is not easy to spawn new pools
when such attacks come in the future.

=== Centralised Block Template Generation

All pool operators use a single block template that they generate and
distribute work to miners based on that block template. Stratum V2
attempts to solve this problem, however, the centralised pool can
still censor a miner by refusing to accept the proposed block template
or refusing to pay the miner after the fact, as the centralised pool
retains the control on their payout mechanism.

=== Opaque Share and Fee Accounting

The collection of shares is opaque in all centralised pools, so miners
can't verify that they are being paid fairly. Ocean's approach with
https://ocean.xyz/docs/tides[TIDES] enables verification of each
miner's shares, however, miners still can't verify the fees charged by
the pool is uniform across all miners. It is quiet possible that
larger miners get a discounted fees on centralised pools.

=== Custodial Miner Payouts

All centralised pools pay miner's in a custodial manner and therefore
can hold miner hostage into following arbitrary rules imposed by the
pool operator. The only choice a miner has to move to another
centralised pool.

== Problem With P2P Pools

=== Added Friction To Migrate

Peer to peer pools require that miners run additional services next to
their mining rigs. These services are required to build block
templates and to reach consensus on the share and reward
distribution. We believe this added friction will reduce the adoption
of P2P pools for miners who don't want to run additional services
along with their miners. Given that the long tail of miners can be
critical to resisting mining centralisation pressure, our goal is to
eliminate any friction in moving to Radpool.

=== Custodial Payouts

In P2P pools, miner payouts are under the control of a threshold
signature, which can be hijacked by someone with a 51% hashrate on the
pool. Ideally, we need a solution where a mining doesn't require
permission from the threshold of miners to exit the pool with their
payout. Braidpool's
https://gist.github.com/pool2win/77bb9b98f9f3b8c0f90963343c3c840f[UHPO
model] is an example where a miner needs permission from a threshold
of miners to exit with their payout.

=== Challenges of Scale

P2Pool used a single block chain to provide consensus on the PoW
shares generated by miners. However, the use of linear chain resulted
in the limits on how many miners the pool could co-ordinate. As more
miners joined the pool, more shares were deemed Dead on Arrival,
i.e. they didn't earn a reward for the work done. This problem can be
solved by using a DAG instead of a linear chain, however, reaching
consensus on the scale of 10,000 nodes is still an unsolved
problem. There are some protocols from academia, but none of those
have reached production scale of tens of thousands of nodes. Kaspa
uses a https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf[DAG based PoW backed
consensus algorithm], but Kaspa's network is https://kas.fyi/[still
less than 500 nodes]. If we need to scale to tens of thousands of
miners, we don't yet have a proven consensus protocol that can scale
to such a large network.

=== Threshold Signature In P2P Network Model

Running Threshold Signatures on a P2P model also has challenges. The
network model required by FROST needs nodes to be connected in a point
to point network, and running gossip broadcast breaks the assumptions
made in the security proofs of threshold signature protocols.

The next pages present a new design that uses a syndicate of operators
to replace centralised pool operators, and avoids the above listed
problems. First we describe our solution and then address how we avoid
all of the above problems.
