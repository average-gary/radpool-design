= System Overview

The diagarm below shows how the miners and federation members
communicate. Note, there is no peer to peer communication between
miners. Only the federation members use p2p communication for
consistent state replication and reaching byzantine fault tolerant
agreement.

Miners register with any federation member, and then communicate with
the federation member's stratum instance. The federation member signs
the shares it receives from the miner before broadcasting them to the
rest of the federation. This helps in identifying the federation
members that are serving each of the miners. We will see later why
this becomes important when it comes to fee distribution among the
federation members.
