= System Overview

The diagarm below shows how the miners and syndicate members
communicate. Note, there is no peer to peer communication between
miners. Only the syndicate members use p2p communication for
consistent state replication and reaching byzantine fault tolerant
agreement.

Miners register with any syndicate member, and then communicate with
the syndicate member's stratum instance. The syndicate member signs
the shares it receives from the miner before broadcasting them to the
rest of the syndicate. This helps in identifying the syndicate
members that are serving each of the miners. We will see later why
this becomes important when it comes to fee distribution among the
syndicate members.
