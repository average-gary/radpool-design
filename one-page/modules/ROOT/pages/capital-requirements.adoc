== Capital Requirements and Risks Mitigation

The capital required to fund the pool is distributed across the
federation members reducing the capital risks for any individual
federation member.

When a new member wants to join a federation, the existing members
will see reduced earnings. The federation is incentivized to grow as a
larger federation can manage payouts for larger number of miners and
thus can provide reduced variance for all miners and thus attract more
miners. This flywheel effect is important for any federation to try
and achieve, for which expanding the size of the federation is
important.
