= Radpool - A Mining Syndicate

TODO: Change to MSP
.Radpool - Syndicated, Decentralised Mining Pool
image::radpool-syndicated-pool.png["syndicated pools",425,425]

In Radpool, we replace a single centralised mining operator with a
syndicate of operators called Miner Service Providers of MSPs. The
syndicate resists mining centralisation by breaking up the centralised
pool. The members of the syndicate build blocktemplates, enable miner
payouts, and help reduce variance for miners by working together as a
pool.

There are two types of parties in the system.

. Miners - these run mining facilities and do not need to run bitcoin node or a radpool node.
. Mining Service Providers - these run bitcoin nodes, generate block templates and collaborate to publish signatures that pay miners and the MSPs

== Mining Service Providers

Miners register with an MSP and communicate with the syndicate using
stratum mining protocol. MSP take on the complexity in this design,
allowing miners to switch from centralised pools without running any
services. Here's a list of responsibilities the MSPs take on:

. Build block templates.
. Run services to let miners register with them.
. Run stratum servers that communicate work to miners.
. Replicate block templates generated by all MSPs across the syndicate.
. Replicate PoW shares generated by all miners across the syndicate.

== Miners

The miner's on the other hand simply need a service to manage their
payouts. This can be a simple mobile application or an onsite service
if they prefer. The important point here is that miners do not receive
the network traffic of the entire pool and therefore do no need high
throughput network connections.

== Coinbase and Miner Payouts

In radpool, the coinbase for block rewards requires a
constant amount of disk space, so radpool scale is not limited by the
coinbase size.

The payout transaction is constructed such that neither the miner nor
any syndicate member can steal coins or prevent the mining syndicate
from making progress.

=== Futures Contracts using DLCs

DLCs, https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs:[Discrete Log
Contracts], enable futures contracts between two parties with a third
party acting as an oracle to settle the contract on expiry. In our
case, the two parties are MSP and the miner. The oracle is the Radpool
syndicate.

All miners are paid by MSPs using DLC contracts. The miners and MSPs
generate contracts where MSPs pay miners an agreed upon amount of BTC
on contract expiry, if and only if Radpool can confirm that the miner
generated the given amount of hashrate over the contract period.

Such a payout mechanism has the following features:

. MSPs pay miners with futures contract built using DLCs.
. Radpool acts as an Oracle where a threshold number of MSPs generate the signature.
. MSPs earn a yield in exchange of locking liquidity that fund payouts for miners.
. The payout mechanism allows unilateral exits for miners and MSPs, thus making the solution non-custodial.
