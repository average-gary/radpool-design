= Radpool - A Mining Syndicate

image::radpool.png[alt="radpool",width="50%"]

In Radpool, we replace a single centralised mining operator with a
syndicate of operators. The syndicate resists mining centralisation by
breaking up the centralised pool. The members of the syndicate build
blocktemplates, enable miner payouts, and help reduce variance for
miners by working together as a pool.

There are two types of parties in the system.

. Miners - these run mining facilities and do not need to run bitcoin node or a radpool node.
. Syndicate members or operators - these run bitcoin nodes, generate block templates and sign miner payout transactions using threshold signatures.

== Syndicate Operators

Miners register with a syndicate members and communicate with the
syndicate using stratum mining protocol. Syndicate members take on the
complexity in this design, allowing miners to switch from centralised
pools without running any services. Here's a list of responsibilities
the syndicate members take on:

. Build block templates.
. Run services to let miners register with them.
. Run stratum servers that communicate work to miners.
. Maintain replica of all of the PoW shares generate by all miners.

== Miners

The miner's on the other hand simply need a service to manage their
payouts. This can be a simple mobile application or an onsite service
if they prefer. The important point here is that miners do not receive
the network traffic of the entire pool and therefore do no need high
throughput network connections.

== Coinbase and Miner Payouts

In radpool, the coinbase for block rewards requires a
constant amount of disk space, so radpool scale is not limited by the
coinbase size.

The payout transaction is constructed such that neither the miner nor
any syndicate member can steal coins or prevent the mining syndicate
from making progress.
