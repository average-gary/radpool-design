= Submit Shares to Syndicate: Stratum

The miner signs the shares it submits to the syndicate members. Miners
will use a proxy for signing their shares. The shares are signed by
using the same public key that the miner registered for receiving
payouts.

TIP: The signing of shares and using the proxy is optional.

If the miner does not sign the shares, then it is trusting the
syndicate member to not steal their shares. However, if the syndicate
member steals the shares the miners can observe this by subscribing to
the syndicate p2p broadcast that replicates shares across the
syndicate and observing all the shares the syndicate is receiving.
