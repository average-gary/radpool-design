= Federation Membership

Group membership has a reduction to consensus. In our trust model, we
require this consensus to have byzantine fault tolerant
properties. This makes it hard to track who are the current members of
the federation. To solve the problem, we turn to using Bitcoin
consensus for maintaining the federation membership.

Federation members provide inputs into a membership transaction. The
outputs of the membership transaction require the federation threshold
signature to spend and carry a dust amount. The outputs of the
membership transaction are used as inputs into funding transactions
that manage the payouts made to miners.

By requiring a bitcoin transaction to be confirmed and have certain
minimum confirmations, we solve the federation's membership problem
using bitcoin's BFT consensus.
